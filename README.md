1. Create a generic class called "Stack<T>" that implements a stack data structure.
The class should have the following methods:
 "Push" method that adds an item of type T to the top of the stack.
 "Pop" method that removes and returns the top item from the stack.
 "Peek" method that returns the top item from the stack without removing it.
 "IsEmpty" method that returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
2. Create an instance of the "Stack<int>" class and perform various push and pop
operations. Print out the remaining items in the stack after each operation.
